# A framework (maybe temporarily!) for Chrome Extensions with audio interactions!

## Reference:

[Chrome Extension content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts)

[Chrome Extension notifications](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/notifications)

[Chrome Extension message passing](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/messaging)

## How to use it?

I assume you're a developer and can read the code to understand where to go from this raw framework.

### To try it as-is: 

* Open the extension page of chrome browser.
* Turn on developer mode.
* load this unpacked extension.
* open a *.google.com/* webpage (google.com can also work)
* speak: "test *something*"
* you should be able to see a new notification with *something*.
